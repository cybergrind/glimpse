# WiFi Provider

**Source:** NetworkManager D-Bus (`org.freedesktop.NetworkManager`, system bus)

**What it does:** Lists WiFi access points, manages connections (connect, disconnect, forget), controls WiFi radio state, and reports signal strength and security info.

## System Interface

### org.freedesktop.NetworkManager (object: `/org/freedesktop/NetworkManager`)

Methods:
- `GetDevices() -> Vec<ObjectPath>` — list all network devices
- `ActivateConnection(connection: ObjectPath, device: ObjectPath, specific_object: ObjectPath) -> ObjectPath` — activate a saved connection; `specific_object` = AP path or "/" for auto
- `AddAndActivateConnection(settings: HashMap<String, HashMap<String, Variant>>, device: ObjectPath, specific_object: ObjectPath) -> (ObjectPath, ObjectPath)` — create new connection and activate; returns (connection_path, active_connection_path)
- `DeactivateConnection(active_connection: ObjectPath)` — disconnect

Properties:
- `Devices: Vec<ObjectPath>`
- `ActiveConnections: Vec<ObjectPath>` — currently active connection paths
- `WirelessEnabled: bool` (R/W) — WiFi radio soft state
- `WirelessHardwareEnabled: bool` (RO) — hardware RF-kill state
- `NetworkingEnabled: bool`
- `State: u32` — NMState (see below)
- `PrimaryConnection: ObjectPath`
- `Metered: u32` — 0=unknown, 1=yes, 2=no, 3=guess-yes, 4=guess-no
- `Connectivity: u32` — 0=unknown, 1=none, 2=portal, 3=limited, 4=full

Signals:
- `StateChanged(state: u32)`
- `DeviceAdded(device: ObjectPath)`
- `DeviceRemoved(device: ObjectPath)`

NMState values:
- 0=Unknown, 10=Asleep, 20=Disconnected, 30=Disconnecting, 40=Connecting, 50=ConnectedLocal, 60=ConnectedSite, 70=ConnectedGlobal

### org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.Device.Wireless (object: device path)

- `ActiveAccessPoint: ObjectPath` — "/" if not connected
- `Mode: u32` — 0=unknown, 1=adhoc, 2=infrastructure, 3=ap

- `LastScan: i64` — CLOCK_BOOTTIME milliseconds of last scan (-1 = never)
- `PermHwAddress: String` — permanent MAC
- `WirelessCapabilities: u32`

Signals:
- `AccessPointAdded(ap: ObjectPath)`
- `AccessPointRemoved(ap: ObjectPath)`

### org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.AccessPoint (object: AP path)

Properties:
- `Ssid: Vec<u8>` — network name as raw bytes
- `Strength: u8` — signal strength 0–100
- `Frequency: u32` — channel frequency in MHz
- `HwAddress: String` — BSSID (MAC address)
- `MaxBitrate: u32` — max speed in Kb/s
- `Bandwidth: u32` — channel bandwidth in MHz
- `Mode: u32` — 0=unknown, 1=adhoc, 2=infrastructure, 3=ap
- `LastSeen: i32` — CLOCK_BOOTTIME seconds (-1 = never)
- `Flags: u32` — AP flags (see below)
- `WpaFlags: u32` — WPA security flags
- `RsnFlags: u32` — RSN (WPA2/WPA3) security flags

AP flags (NM80211ApFlags):
- `0x01` = PRIVACY (requires auth/encryption)
- `0x02` = WPS
- `0x04` = WPS_PBC (push-button)
- `0x08` = WPS_PIN

Security flags (NM80211ApSecurityFlags) — used for both WpaFlags and RsnFlags:
- `0x001` = PAIR_WEP40
- `0x002` = PAIR_WEP104
- `0x004` = PAIR_TKIP
- `0x008` = PAIR_CCMP (AES)
- `0x010` = GROUP_WEP40
- `0x020` = GROUP_WEP104
- `0x040` = GROUP_TKIP
- `0x080` = GROUP_CCMP
- `0x100` = KEY_MGMT_PSK (WPA/WPA2 personal)
- `0x200` = KEY_MGMT_802_1X (enterprise)
- `0x400` = KEY_MGMT_SAE (WPA3 personal)
- `0x800` = KEY_MGMT_OWE (opportunistic, no password)

Determining security type:
- WpaFlags == 0 && RsnFlags == 0 → Open
- (WpaFlags | RsnFlags) & 0x400 → WPA3
- (WpaFlags | RsnFlags) & 0x100 → WPA/WPA2 PSK
- (WpaFlags | RsnFlags) & 0x200 → Enterprise (802.1X)
- Flags & 0x01 only → WEP (legacy)

### org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.Connection.Active (object: active connection path)

Properties:
- `Connection: ObjectPath` — settings connection path
- `Id: String` — connection name
- `Uuid: String`

- `Devices: Vec<ObjectPath>`
- `State: u32` — 0=unknown, 1=activating, 2=activated, 3=deactivating, 4=deactivated
- `Default: bool` — is IPv4 default route
- `Ip4Config: ObjectPath`
- `Ip6Config: ObjectPath`
- `Vpn: bool`

- `GetSecrets(setting_name: String) -> HashMap<String, HashMap<String, Variant>>` — get passwords
- `Delete()` — forget/remove connection
- `Update(settings: HashMap<String, HashMap<String, Variant>>)` — update and save

### Connection workflows

Connect to known network:
1. `Settings.ListConnections()` → find connection matching SSID
2. `Manager.ActivateConnection(connection_path, device_path, "/")` → activate
3. Monitor `ActiveConnection.StateChanged` for state 2 (activated)

Connect to new network with password:
1. Build settings dict with `802-11-wireless` (ssid), `802-11-wireless-security` (key-mgmt: "wpa-psk", psk: password), `ipv4` (method: "auto"), `ipv6` (method: "auto")
2. `Manager.AddAndActivateConnection(settings, device_path, ap_path)` → creates and connects
3. Monitor `ActiveConnection.StateChanged`

Forget network:
1. Find connection via `Settings.ListConnections()` + `GetSettings()`
2. `Connection.Delete()`

Enable/disable WiFi:
- Set `Manager.WirelessEnabled` property to true/false

## Crates

- `zbus` (5) — D-Bus client for NetworkManager
- `networkmanager` (0.3) — NetworkManager D-Bus bindings (optional, can use raw zbus)

## Change Detection

**D-Bus signals (fully reactive):**
- `Manager.StateChanged` — overall network state
- `Manager.PropertiesChanged` — `WirelessEnabled`, `ActiveConnections` changes
- `Device.Wireless.AccessPointAdded` / `AccessPointRemoved` — scan results
- `Device.Wireless.PropertiesChanged` — `LastScan` for scan completion
- `ActiveConnection.StateChanged` — connection progress
- `Settings.NewConnection` / `ConnectionRemoved` — saved networks changed

**Signal strength:** No dedicated signal. Poll `AccessPoint.Strength` property every 1–2 seconds for real-time signal display, or use `PropertiesChanged` on the active AP.

## Features

- List all visible access points with SSID, signal strength, security type, frequency
- Connect to known (saved) networks
- Connect to new networks with password (WPA/WPA2/WPA3)
- Disconnect from current network
- Forget saved networks
- Enable/disable WiFi radio
- Trigger manual WiFi scan
- Report hardware RF-kill state
- Active connection details: IP address, bitrate, signal
- Internet connectivity detection (none/portal/limited/full)
- Metered connection detection
- WiFi adapter listing with capabilities
- Saved/known network management
- Captive portal detection
- WPA3 and OWE security support
- Hidden SSID scanning

## Notes

- All interfaces are on system bus, not session bus
- SSID is a byte array — may contain non-UTF8 data; display with lossy conversion
- `WirelessHardwareEnabled` = false means physical RF-kill switch is on — software cannot override
- `AddAndActivateConnection` both saves and connects in one call — preferred for new networks
- Signal strength poll interval should be 1–2 seconds for responsive UI
- NetworkManager may not be installed on all systems — provider should handle absence
