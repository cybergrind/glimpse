# Bluetooth Provider

**Source:** BlueZ D-Bus (`org.bluez`, system bus)

**What it does:** Lists Bluetooth adapters and devices, manages pairing/trust/connect/disconnect, controls discovery, reports device battery levels, and handles adapter power state.

## System Interface

BlueZ uses `org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager` at `/org/bluez` for the entire object tree.

### ObjectManager (object: `/org/bluez`)

- `InterfacesRemoved(path: ObjectPath, interfaces: Vec<String>)` — device removed or interface lost

### org.bluez.Adapter1 (object: `/org/bluez/hci{N}`)

Methods:
- `StartDiscovery()` — begin scanning for devices
- `StopDiscovery()` — stop scanning
- `RemoveDevice(device: ObjectPath)` — remove device and pairing data
- `SetDiscoveryFilter(filter: HashMap<String, Variant>)` — filter by UUIDs, RSSI threshold, transport type
- `GetDiscoveryFilters() -> Vec<String>` — available filter keys

Properties:
- `Address: String` (RO) — adapter MAC address

### org.bluez.Battery1 (same device object, additional interface)

Properties:
- `Percentage: u8` (RO) — battery level 0–100
- `Source: String` (RO, optional) — data source ("HFP 1.7", "HID", UUID)

Note: Only present on devices that report battery (headsets, mice, keyboards via HID/HFP/BLE).

### org.bluez.AgentManager1 (object: `/org/bluez`)

### org.bluez.Agent1 (implemented by the daemon)

Methods BlueZ calls on the agent during pairing:
- `RequestPinCode(device: ObjectPath) -> String` — legacy PIN (1-16 chars)

- `RequestAuthorization(device: ObjectPath)` — authorize incoming pairing
- `AuthorizeService(device: ObjectPath, uuid: String)` — grant service access
- `Cancel()` — pairing cancelled
- `Release()` — agent unregistered

### Device class decoding

Major device class from `Class` property: `(class >> 8) & 0x1F`

- `0x01` = Computer (desktop, laptop, server, tablet)
- `0x02` = Phone (cellular, cordless, smartphone)
- `0x03` = LAN/Network Access Point
- `0x04` = Audio/Video (headset, speaker, microphone, camcorder)
- `0x05` = Peripheral (keyboard, mouse, joystick, gamepad)
- `0x06` = Imaging (printer, scanner, camera)
- `0x07` = Wearable (watch, pager, jacket, helmet)
- `0x08` = Toy
- `0x09` = Health (blood pressure, thermometer, heart rate)
- `0x1F` = Uncategorized

### Connection workflows

Pair a new device:
1. `Adapter.StartDiscovery()`
2. Wait for `InterfacesAdded` with `org.bluez.Device1`
3. `Device.Pair()` — agent handles user interaction
4. `Device.Trusted = true` — allow auto-connect
5. `Device.Connect()` — connect profiles
6. `Adapter.StopDiscovery()`

Connect to paired device:
1. `Device.Connect()` — connects all auto-connectable profiles
2. Monitor `Device.Connected` via `PropertiesChanged`

Forget/remove device:
1. `Adapter.RemoveDevice(device_path)` — removes pairing and bond data

## Icons

Adapter state:
- `bluetooth-active-symbolic` — Bluetooth on
- `bluetooth-disabled-symbolic` — Bluetooth off

Device types (from BlueZ `Icon` property or derived from class):
- `audio-headphones-symbolic` — headphones / earbuds
- `audio-headset-symbolic` — headset with mic
- `audio-speakers-symbolic` — speakers
- `input-keyboard-symbolic` — keyboard
- `input-mouse-symbolic` — mouse
- `input-gaming-symbolic` — game controller
- `input-tablet-symbolic` — drawing tablet
- `phone-symbolic` — phone
- `computer-symbolic` — computer
- `video-display-symbolic` — display / TV

All icons above are available in Adwaita icon theme.

## Crates

- `bluer` (0.16) — official BlueZ Rust bindings; async, type-safe, handles ObjectManager/Agent/GATT. Recommended over raw zbus for this provider.
- `zbus` (5) — alternative: raw D-Bus access if bluer doesn't cover a specific need

## Change Detection

**Fully reactive via D-Bus signals:**

- `ObjectManager.InterfacesAdded` — new device discovered, or battery interface appears on existing device
- `ObjectManager.InterfacesRemoved` — device removed or out of range
- `Device1.PropertiesChanged` — connection state, RSSI, paired, trusted, name changes
- `Adapter1.PropertiesChanged` — powered, discovering, discoverable changes
- `Battery1.PropertiesChanged` — battery percentage changes

**Recommended pattern:**
1. `GetManagedObjects()` for initial state
2. Subscribe to `InterfacesAdded`/`InterfacesRemoved` on ObjectManager
3. Subscribe to `PropertiesChanged` on each adapter and device
4. Maintain local cache, emit provider events on each signal

No polling needed — BlueZ is fully signal-driven.

## Features

- List Bluetooth adapters with power/discoverable/discovering state
- List all known devices with connection, pairing, trust, blocked state
- Device discovery (start/stop scanning)
- Pairing with agent support (passkey confirmation, PIN entry)
- Connect/disconnect individual devices or specific profiles
- Trust/block device management
- Forget (remove) devices with bond data cleanup
- Device battery level reporting (via Battery1 interface)
- Device class detection (audio, peripheral, phone, computer, etc.)
- RSSI signal strength monitoring during discovery
- Multiple adapter support
- BLE device support (address type, GATT services)
- Manufacturer and service advertisement data
- Audio profile management (A2DP, HSP/HFP via ConnectProfile)
- Discoverable mode control with timeout

## Notes

- BlueZ uses ObjectManager pattern — always prefer `GetManagedObjects()` over per-object queries for initial load
- `bluer` crate is the official binding and handles the ObjectManager pattern, Agent registration, and async streams natively
- Battery1 interface is only present on devices that report battery — check `InterfacesAdded` for its appearance
- The `Icon` property on Device1 provides BlueZ's suggestion for which icon to use — often accurate
- Audio profile switching (A2DP ↔ HFP) is handled at the PulseAudio/PipeWire card level, not directly through BlueZ
- `Trusted = true` allows a device to auto-connect when in range — important for headphones and keyboards
- RSSI is only available during active discovery scanning
